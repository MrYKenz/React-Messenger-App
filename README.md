# React-Messenger-App :mailbox:

React messenger app using the Chatkit API

I have used React's new 16.8 Hook update of useState() to create a functional component for InputMessage as opposed to the ES6 Class Syntax extending React.Component.  

For Future: The new useEffect() method could be used to replace componentDidMount() in the App Class.
