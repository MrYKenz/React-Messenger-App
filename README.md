# React-Messenger-App :mailbox:

React messenger app using the Chatkit API (https://pusher.com/chatkit)

I have used React's new 16.8 Hook update of useState() to create a functional component for InputMessage.js as opposed to the ES6 Class Syntax extending React.Component.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react'
const [state, setState] = useState();
``` 

**For Future**: The new useEffect() method could be used to replace componentDidMount() in the App Class.

```javascript
=useEffect();
```
